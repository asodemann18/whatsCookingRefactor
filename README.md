# What's Cooking Refactor

# Project By: [Carlos Flores](https://github.com/carflor), [Edwin Montealvo](https://github.com/emontealvo), and [Alex Sodemann](https://github.com/asodemann18)

# About
We built on top of somebody else’s pre-existing Whats Cookin’ codebase and added new functionality.

# Project Goals
* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone else’s codebase
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening
